Advanced Games Programming 

I did not manage to get everything working together, however the main components are there.

I have tried to follow an Object-Oriented Programming as much as I could.

What I have added are:

 - Character Controller
 - Inventory and Equipment system
 - Item Interaction
 - Enemy Script
 - Combat System
 - Procedural Generation

I have managed to get everything working together apart from the Procedural Generation to work.

Thus, I have added another level to demonstrate the Procedural Generation that I have added.
You can find it in the main menu by pressing the "Procedural Generation" button.
Then you can click the "Procedural Dungeon Generation" button to generate a dungeon.

Or by opening the "Dungeon Generation Test" scene in the Unity editor.
In the "Dungeon Generation Test" scene you can go to the "DungeonCreation" game object and press the "CreateNewDungeon" button, to generate a new dungeon layout.
You can also change the parameters in the editor to directly change the Generation.
